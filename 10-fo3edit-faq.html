<h3 class="header3" id="Overview">10.1 - Overview</h3>
<p>The idea behind the FAQ is to make it easier for you to find the xEdit information that you need, without having to read this entire manual &#8211; that could put anyone into a coma. As I really don't want the hassle of law suits, it is in both of our best interest that this tutorial is simple to navigate and quick to find resolution to the tasks at hand.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>FAQ Navigation really means using the FAQ to direct you to the right cell (section) of the document that describes what you need to do. In some cases, the FAQ itself will be all the help that is required. In other cases, you may want/need to learn the process at depth. Each Question/Answer combination has a teleport XMarker that you can activate by holding down Control and Left-Clicking on the XMarker with your mouse. Activating the XMarker will teleport you to the appropriate cell in the document for further details.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FAQ is divided into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced sections to better organize the questions, and further insulate your brain from over-exposure to technical documentation. The idea being that most users should start in the Beginner section and advance forward until find the answers you seek. If you do not find the answers you were looking for, please post them in the <a  href="http://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showforum=46">Bethesda GECK Forum</a> so that we can update the FAQ.</p>

<h4 class="header4" id="WhatmodsdoIselectwhenIfirstloadxEdit">10.2.1 - What mods do I select when I first load xEdit</h4>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p><B>Question:</B>  When loading xEdit, do I select all of the mods at once and apply a filter or does it need to be done individually</p>
<p>Two Answers here, depending on what your trying to accomplish:</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  If you're <a  href="5-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#TheConflictDetectionAlgorithm">de-conflicting your mods</a> so that you can play crash-free, then you want to select All of the mods (with the single exception of any previous patch plugin you created, you don't want to load that if you're building a new patch plugin).</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  If you're <a  href="7-mod-cleaning-and-error-checking.html">cleaning your mod</a> or wanting to modify/work on just your own mod, then; Right-click in the load-window and choose, "Select None". Then find your mod in the list and just select that mod. The loader will automatically pick-up any ESM master files that your mod depends on. The section on <a  href="7-mod-cleaning-and-error-checking.html">Mod Cleaning and Error Checking</a> will describe the process at depth.</p>

<h4 class="header4" id="Applingconflictfiltersshowsalmosteverymodhasconflicts">10.2.2 - Appling conflict filters shows almost every mod has conflicts!</h4>
<p><B>Question:</B>  When I apply my conflict detection filter, almost all of the mods in my list have Red backgrounds! Am I totally conflicted here</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  Red isn't necessarily bad, although it does point you to conflicts. With that many mods, a <a  href="5-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#CreatingaMergedPatchAutomaticMethod">merged patch Plugin</a> is a must. Following the instructions in the section on <a  href="5-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#UnderstandingPatchPluginsandMergedPatches">Patch Plugins</a>, and you should see that all of the intended edits will be playing nicer with each other.

<h4 class="header4" id="ShouldImakechangestothemodsifthereisaconflict">10.2.3 - Should I make changes to the mods if there is a conflict</h4>
<p><B>Question:</B>  When <a  href="5-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html">de-conflicting my mod</a>, is it okay to drag/drop changes into the mod with a conflict, or just edit the field in the mod to fix the conflict right in that mod file</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  No, you shouldn't be modifying mods you didn't create yourself like that or you'll just get into trouble the next time one of these mods is updated. Instead you should use &quot;copy as override into&quot; a new Plugin on the currently winning record version and then drag n' drop the changes from all other record versions together. <a  href="5-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#UnderstandingPatchPluginsandMergedPatches">Creating a patch plugin</a> which can be loaded after all the conflicting mods to resolve these conflicts.

<p><B>Question:</B>  Where in the load order should my patch plugin be placed</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  Yes your <a  href="5-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#UnderstandingPatchPluginsandMergedPatches">merged-patch</a> loads last, and the masters (.ESM files) which it patches (.esm's and .esp's) will be automatically added.</p>

<h4 class="header4" id="WhatdoesthepatchpluginreallydoformyFallout3loadorder">10.2.5 - What does the patch plugin really do for my Fallout3 load order</h4>
<p><B>Question:</B>  What does the patch plugin really do for my Fallout3 load order? Do I really need to go through this trouble to create one</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  If you run more than 25 mods, you really do need to create a patch plugin in most cases. What the patch does is to join edits to a mod in such a way that both edits will work on the same thing.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say for example mod #1 says you'll find raiders with flamers and mod #2 adds rocket launchers to them instead. If mod #2 loads last, it will be the conflict winner and you'll find raiders with flamers. <a  href="5-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#UnderstandingPatchPluginsandMergedPatches">If you use a patch Plugin</a>, you'll find raiders with both flamers and rocket launchers. It doesn't always work out this smoothly, but it does in most cases.

<p><B>Answer:</B>  I'm pretty sure I've heard about people complaining about this here on the Forum. I would guess it's one of (many) bugs in BrokenSteel.esm or a conflict with some other mod you've installed.</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  What happens if I still have mod conflicts in-game even after creating a patch Plugin</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  There is frankly nothing that xEdit can do different. Conflicts are the result of either:</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; General bugs in Patch release your running.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; A problem specific to how masters are handled.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; A module file that's broken in some way (which might show up more or at all because 1.5+ ESM is now doing something RIGHT at the engine level).</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; Conflicts between installed modules (ditto)</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  What should I do when I get an error during loading xEdit like this:</p>
<p><code>Record fBloodSplatterFadeStart [GMST:080304D5] is not contained in a group.</code> and I had to disable it to get the master update to complete. Is this something I've done wrong with load order or some sort of conflict, or something that needs to be reported to the mod author to correct in the esp</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  As I said before, there are still many mods out there that have been hacked together in <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/640">FOMM</a> and are not actually structurally valid Fallout 3 module files.</p>

<p>Any module that gives trouble during loading or saving in xEdit is BROKEN anyway and should never be loaded into any game.</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  I've been getting a lot of 0/1kb insertmodnamehere.esp save/backup files in my data folder. What exactly are these</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  When xEdit saves a file, it first writes a new file with .esp/m.save.&lt;datetime&gt; as extension. When you then close the program then the existing original module files are renamed to .esp/m.backup.&lt;datetime&gt; and the newest .esp/m.save.&lt;datetime&gt; file for each module is renamed to .esp/m. These can be deleted without worry of harming your game or mods, and are purely for backup purposes.</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  How many mods can FO3Edit load? I can't seem to get but just half of my mods loaded at one time. I have over 170 mod to edit am I missing something or doing something wrong</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  You can have 256 total mods in Fallout3 and xEdit, one more then the game engine itself. However, xEdit is uses a lot of memory to load entire mod lists and compare everything &#8211; and that goes up the more mods you add. If you find that you cannot run xEdit with a huge number of mods, check to see that your computer is not running out of memory. xEdit will warn you that memory is exhausted in most cases.</p>
<p>I have made xEdit work successfully with close to 200 mods loaded on a Windows XP machine with 3 gigs of Ram.</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  When I first make changes to a mod, I get a huge timed warning that forces me to wait before allowing me to click Yes. Is there any way to turn the three-second modify warning off</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  Yes, but it's there for a reason. Also, the 3 second delay gets reduced by a few fractions of a second every time you confirm that dialog till after a while it's completely gone.</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  I deleted a plugin file but xEdit seems to think it's still there? When xEdit load itself, I see the messages about &quot;Error: Active Plugin List contains nonexistent file &quot;merged.esp&quot;&quot;. I'm absolutely sure- I remove this ESP from load order and from disk with help of <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/640">FOMM</a>. What's the deal</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  That means that you deleted the file from disk, but it's still listed as an active Plugin in your Plugins.txt (see the message log for the location of that file). The Plugins.txt file is used by the game engine to decide which modules to load.</p>
<p>Any listed module which doesn't exist in the file system is just ignored by the game engine (and xEdit). So there is nothing to worry about with that error message. It has no further consequences. If you want to remove the error message, edit the Plugins.txt file and remove its entry from that file.</p>

<p><a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/640"><strong>Question:</strong> So if I make a new load order in</a> <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/640">FOMM</a>, should I make a new merged patch as well right</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  That is correct, if you change the load order you need to create a new merged patch so that the data is always kept in the right order. Failure to do this can result in CTD's. That's why Patch Plugin's should be a last resort and not automatically what you do to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best practice is to create a patch plugin once you are reasonably sure that your load order is settled and static for your current game/character. After you start playing, altering the load order can result in problems for that character, so it's best to put the effort into a patch plugin once you're ready to start seriously gaming OR if you have serious conflicts that can't be resolved by changing the load order alone.</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  I am having problems getting xEdit to work on Vista in the Program Files folder. Am I doing something wrong</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  It is possible to install the game to the Program Files folder under Vista , but you have to deal with the UAC security first. You have three options:</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; 1.Disable the UAC completely, but this will leave your system more vulnerable.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; 2.Install in a folder not controlled by UAC.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; 3.A much better way to solve the problem (of write-redirection to the VirtualStore) is to simply give the &quot;Users&quot; group &quot;Full Control&quot; of the Fallout 3 folder.</p>

<p><B>Answer:</B>  In these cases there is actually a problem with your files or your load order, and xEdit is unable to process them. Exit xEdit and use <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/640">FOMM</a> to check/correct any load order issues. Make sure your patch plugins (if you have one) loads last as well and re-run xEdit.

<p><B>Answer:</B>  No, you should only clean a mod that you own or are on a team that owns. If you think that a mod is very dirty and should be cleaned, the best approach is to recommend it to the mod author on the forums.

<p><B>Answer:</B>  Look at the File Header. Set the ESM Record Flag. Save. You are done. The file extensions do not matter for the game engine.

<p><B>Question:</B>  Why should I "clean" my mod? It works just fine how it is!</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  The large majority of mods currently in circulation are unfortunately in rather appalling condition, with dirty edits, deleted references, unintended changes, you name it. GECK makes it very easy for these things to slip in. Even worse, there are still a significant number of mods out there which have been hacked together in <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/640">FOMM</a> or even hex editors that in no way shape or form conform to the implicit rules of the FO3 module file format. See the chapter on <a  href="7-mod-cleaning-and-error-checking.html">Mod Cleaning and Error Checking</a> for a detailed description of how this is done.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is needed from all mod authors is a concentrated effort to clean up their mods and in general minimize the number of vanilla records they touch to reduce conflict potential.</p>

<p>You can fix it with xEdit by loading FOOK.esp (as you are obviously doing) then going to that record (enter 0002968D into the FormID search edit above the Navigation Treeview and press enter) and then REMOVE that record from FOOK.esp. Make sure that you are removing it from the right file! (It should have the &quot;Deleted&quot; Record Flag set in FOOK.esp).</p>

<p><B>Answer:</B>  NAVM and NAVI records work together in that the NAVI is an index of sorts for the NAVM records. Thus if the cleaning process removes any NAVM records, you must update the NAVI data as well. Thus after any cleaning which touches NAVM records you will have to simply Load and Re-Save the file GECK so that the NAVI records are re-built (which the GECK does automatically when you save).</p>

<p><B>Answer:</B>  Normally the word &quot;remove&quot; is used to describe removing a record from a module (in which case, if it was an override record, the original will &quot;shine through&quot; again).

<h4 class="header4" id="WhatisFallout3Hardcodedesp">10.4.1 - What is Fallout3.Hardcoded.esp</h4>
<p><B>Question:</B>  What is Fallout3.Hardcoded.esp</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  This file contains some records which are hardcoded in GECK and the game engine (not contained in Fallout3.esm) but referenced from records in Fallout3.esm. PlaneMarker and PortalMarker STAT records to name just one example. The Fallout3.Hardcoded.esp must be in the same folder as the xEdit.exe and NOT in the Data folder. The game engine or GECK will never see that file and never load it.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you start GECK without loading Fallout3.esm, you can see that there are some records already defined. The reason is that these records are hardcoded in the exe already. Some of these records are overridden in Fallout3.esm. Some others are not. But Fallout3.esm contains records with references to some of these hardcoded records that are not being overridden.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you now load Fallout3.esm alone in xEdit, which doesn't have these &quot;hardcoded&quot; records in the exe itself like GECK. Then it appears as if Fallout3.esm contains a lot of invalid references. This is where Fallout3.Hardcoded.esp comes in. It contains all the hardcoded records which are not overridden in Fallout3.esm already. By loading this esp at the same load order ID as Fallout3.esm it is as if these records were defined in Fallout3.esm.</p>

Which means that the MAST sub records from the TES4 file header directly give you all the information you need to map FormIDs to files. e.g. if there are 3 MAST sub records then FormIDs starting with 00, 01 and 02 belong to these 3 files in that order, everything starting with 03 (or higher!) belongs to the file you are dumping.</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  My load list is smaller than most here, but I have a large selection of houses that were causing problems, as well as a few others like the vertibird that would crash if you left it and walked away. How do I fix this</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  First, check if any of your active modules are NOT masters. You can see that easily in <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/640">FOMM</a> if any of them are not shown in bold. If yes, run xEdit and you may need to make a manual patch.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, determine the FormID of the problematic character(s). Then start xEdit and don't make any changes to the to-be-loaded modules. Now put the FormID into the FormID search box (above the Navigation Treeview) and hit enter. Check if that record is touched by any of you installed mods. Also check the NPC record that the ACHR is based on (you can hold down CTRL and then click on the NAME field to jump to that record).</p>

<h4 class="header4" id="WillxEditmergetheEyesHairsMouthpiecesetc">10.4.13 - Will xEdit merge the Eyes, Hairs, Mouth pieces, etc</h4>
<p><B>Question:</B>  When merging patches that modify facial characteristics, will xEdit merge the Eyes, Hairs, Mouth pieces, etc</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  Important with that: eyes and hairs are merged, the rest not. So if you (or anyone) have a mod which makes changes to something other then hairs or eyes, load that mod last so that the hair and eye changes get merged into it.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that means that TK's eyelash mod has to be last since it mods a lot of the head parts (like merging the whole mouth to make an open slot for the eyelashes).</p>

<p><B>Question:</B>  Is it possible to get the destruction data that I created for my mod into the merged patch or should I just do it by hand</p>
<p><B>Answer:</B>  Destruction data is not one of the things handled by the merged patch function, so you will need to add those elements by-hand to the patch Plugin.</p>
