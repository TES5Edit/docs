            <li>Compare with external tool option in Edit window.</li>
            <li>"Apply Filter for Cleaning" menu. Note that xEdit saves filter settings when you press OK button in filter

        <h3>Version 3.0.15 contains the following changes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>double click on a FormID in the message view while holding CTRL jumps to that record</li>

        <h3>What's new in Version 2.5.3:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixes assert error when copying certain subrecords.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What's new in Version 2.5.1:</h3>
        <p>Bug Fix: floating point comparison is now less "fuzzy". This can result in some floating point numbers now
            comparing as unequal even though they are within the limit of the accuracy of single (4 byte) floating point
            values. But it will prevent cases where floats that should be unequal compared as equal.
        </p>
        <h3>What's new in Version 2.5.0:</h3>
        <p>Context menu on file node in navigation treeview -> Renumber FormIDs from...</p>
        <p>Renumber FormIDs from will change all FormIDs of records belonging to that file (but not any override
            records which might be contained in that file) so that they start at the specified value. This is useful if you
            have multiple modules that you plan to update in the future, but also want to always
            provide a merged version (e.g. using FO3Plugin). By assigning non overlapping FormIDs to the different
            modules, you can make sure that no FormID reassignment of conflicting FormIDs has to take place when
            merging.
        </p>
        <p>WARNING: changing the FormIDs of an existing module will make it savegame incompatible and will break any
            other module that uses this module as master. If you have any dependant modules, you need to have them all
            loaded into xEdit at the time you change to FormIDs so that they will all be updated accordingly. Also,
            this version has been compiled with the "large address aware" flag and will be able to use up to 4GB when
            running under a 64bit version of Windows.
        </p>
        <h3>What's new in 2.3.0 EXPERIMENTAL:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>large number of small fixes to record definition, resulting in many more cases of records correctly
                identified as "identical to master" and a very significant reduction in potential false positives in the
                "Check for Errors" function.
            </li>
            <li>on the fly conversion of outdated records to the most current format. This means that you will see fields
                show up as modified that you didn't modify yourself (mainly in Oblivion.esm, CS created files should already
                be up to date). It is possible to disable this function by starting xEdit with -nofixup as parameter. It is
                also possible to just these modifications (but still keep the fixups) by starting TES4Edit with -hidefixup as
                paramter. This function replaces the -fixupPGRD from earlier versions
            </li>
            <li>New function to copy idle animations</li>
            <li>Bugfix to prevent dialog choices from being sorted by FormID</li>
            <li>The Undelete and Disable function will set the Player ACHR [00000014] as Enable Parent with the "Set Enable
                State to Opposite of Parent" flag set. Given that the player should never end up being disabled, that should
                properly remove them from the gameworld, even if they are persistent references and the enabled state has
                already been stored in the savegame.
            </li>
            <li>The Undelete and Disable function will also now properly list all affected references, just like the "Remove
                'Identical to Master' Record" function does. The selection dialog now allows double clicking an entry, this
                will automatically select that entry, deselect all others and close the dialog as if the OK button had been
                pressed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What's new in 2.2.3:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Game Settings (GMST) will now be properly resolved based on EditorID, not FormID.</li>
            <li>A field in the Region record was improperly defined as a Float field.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What's new in 2.2.0:</h3>
        <p>This version contains no major new functionality, but a number of bugfixes. Update is highly recommended.</p>
        <p>TES4View is an advanced graphical esp viewer and conflict detector.</p>
        <p>When started it will automatically find your Oblivion Data directory. You then get a dialog to select which
            masters/plugins you want to load with the current selection from your plugins.txt as default value. This is
            followed by a second dialog which lets you choose which records not to load. By default this is LAND, PGRD, ROAD
            and REGN because these records are very large and usually not very interesting to look at. Once you have
            confirmed that dialog the selected plugins will start loading them in the background. Depending on your system
            it should take 30 seconds to a few minutes (!) for all plugins to load. You can follow the progress in the
            message window. (Don't panic if it seems to freeze, it just takes time).
        </p>
        <p>The tree view on the left side now shows all active masters and plugins in their correct load order. By
            navigating that tree view you can look at every single record in any of your masters or plugins.
        </p>
        <p>Once a record has been selected the detailed contents of that record is shown on the right side. The detail view
            shows all versions of the selected record from all plugins which contain it. The left most column is the master.
            The right most column is the plugin that "wins". This is the version of the record that Oblivion sees.
        </p>
        <p>Both the detail view and the record list use the same color coding to signal the conflict state of individual
            fields (in the detail view) and the record overall (in the record list).
        </p>
        <h4>Background color:</h4>
        White - Single Record<br>
        Green - Multiple but no conflict<br>
        Yellow - Override without conflict<br>
        Red - Conflict<br>
        <h4>Text color:</h4>
        Black - Single Record<br>
        Gray - Hidden by Mod Group<br>
        Purple - Master<br>
        Gray - Identical to Master<br>
        Orange - Identical to Master but conflict Winner<br>
        Green - Override without conflict<br>
        Orange - Conflict winner<br>
        Red - Conflict loser<br>
        <p>Conflict detection is not simply based on the existence of multiple records for the same FormID in different
            plugins but instead performs a comparison of the parsed subrecord data.
        </p>
        <p>The record tree view on the left side has a context menu where you can activate filtering. Filtering is based on
            the same conflict categorization as the background and text color.
        </p>
        <p>Yes, filtering will take a while. It has to decode and compare the contents of every single record which turns
            up more then once.
        </p>
        <h3>What's new in 1.1:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Game Settings are handled correctly now</li>
            <li>Function Type and Params in Conditions are decoded completely</li>
            <li>Mod Groups (more about that later)</li>
            <li>Settings (records to skip, mod groups, filter) are loaded/saved into a .tes4viewsettings file with the
                same path and name as the plugins.txt (or the plugin list passed on the command line)
            </li>
            <li>Possible range check error when loading a file with errors should be gone</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What's new in 1.2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Filtering the first time should be noticable faster</li>
            <li>Filtering a 2nd time should be over almost instantly</li>
            <li>New conflict category "Hidden by Mod Group" which can be filtered on</li>
            <li>When sorting by EditorID or Name the files get sorted by filename instead of load order</li>
            <li>Improved parsing of Path Grids</li>
            <li>A lot of "unknown" fields and flag values now have a proper name</li>
            <li>Selection dialog (used for files, record to skip, mod groups, ..) has a context menu with "Select all",
                "Select None" and "Invert Selection"
            </li>
            <li>added a couple more mod groups for the official plugins</li>
            <li>Bugfix: Filtering could wrongly filter out records with conflicts if their parent is also a record (not a
                group) and didn't contain a conflict
            </li>
            <li>numerous tweaks to the mechanism which assigns conflict classifications</li>
            <li>When filtering it is possible to "Build reference information" (adds quite a bit of additional processing</li>
            time). After this has been done a new tab "Referenced By" is available if the currently selected record is
            referenced by any other records.</li>
            <li>Mod groups are applied better under certain circumstances.</li>
            <li>double clicking on a row in the right side treeview will open a window that shows the text of that field</li>
            in a multi line memo. So you can now easily read scripts or books</li>
            <li>everything I've forgotton about ;)</li>
