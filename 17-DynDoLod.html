<p>Install SKSE according to its documentations</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install the Core Files from DynDOLOD Resources, which contain the folders 'interface', 'meshes', 'textures' and 'scripts' into Skyrims 'Data' folder. Typically overwrite any files or refer to the manual Load/Overwrite Orders. Install other options from DynDOLOD Resources as desired.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either install <a  href="https://forum.step-project.com/topic/13716-dyndolod-dll">DynDOLOD DLL</a> (overwrite papyrus scripts of DynDOLOD Resources) or PapyrusUtil according to their documentations.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install Vanilla Skyrim LOD Billboards from <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62698/">TES5LODGen</a>, <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75269/">Indistinguishable Vanilla Tree Billboards</a> or <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11446/">Indistinguishable Billboards for Skyrim Special Edition</a> and let them overwrite any DynDOLOD Resources files. Then overwrite with any LOD Billboards for mods in the load order in the same order as their mods. For STEP users all billboards are included in <a  href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11/">STEP Texture Compilation</a>.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the load order, install patches from DynDOLOD Patches. Go to the <B>Compatibility - Some Assembly Required</B> in the file <code>DynDOLOD_Manual.html</code> provided with the DynDoLod download to see if a patch is required. Patches need to overwrite files of the mods they are patching.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the DynDOLOD Standalone archive copy the content of the 'DynDOLOD' folder, which contains the files TexGen.exe/TexGenx64.exe, TexGen.exe/TexGenx64.exe, DynDOLOD_QuickStart.html and the sub folders 'Docs' and 'Edit Scripts' with all their content into a new 'DynDOLOD' folder outside of special OS folders like 'Programs Files' or 'Program Files (x86)', the SteamApps or game folders and Mod Organizers virtual file structure. Do not mix with old versions or xEdit installation.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a mod provides its own version of certain LOD textures its probably best to not overwrite them. However there are some mods that contain the same old vanilla textures again for no apparent reason. Rule of thumb: if the mod is a texture replacer, use its LOD textures. If a mod doesn't visually change textures from vanilla, overwrite its LOD textures. If in doubt visually compare the LOD textures to make a judgment call with version resembles the full textures better.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a texture replacer is used, consider updating LOD textures with <code>TexGen.exe</code> for the load order before running DynDOLOD.exe. It is a simple tool that generates some LOD textures based on the full textures of the current load order. This process is limited and can not update pre-rendered object LOD textures.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the DynDOLOD plugins were created, let LOOT sort its load order based on its masters.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="header2" id="LoadOverwriteOrders">17.3 - Load/Overwrite Orders</h2>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to generate LOD several different resources are used. Lets separate the several resources and what they result in:</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; Billboards source textures -> generated LOD meshes/generated LOD atlas textures</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; LOD source meshes -> generated LOD meshes</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp; LOD source textures -> generated LOD atlas textures</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same Billboard source textures included in DynDOLOD Resources may also be included in the Vanilla+DLC billboards from TES5LODGen. DynDOLOD/Vanilla+DLC billboards need to loaded before any other billboards. Billboards for other mods need to overwrite DynDOLOD/Vanilla+DLC billboards. Billboards for other mods need to overwrite other billboards for other mods in the same order as their "parent" mods overwrites the full model trees.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>DynDOLOD Resources LOD source meshes need to overwrite any vanilla LOD source meshes. New lands mods often add the same vanilla LOD source meshes again for no apparent reason, but DynDOLOD Resources LOD source meshes also need to overwrite them. This more or less happens automatically because the loose DynDOLOD Resources files overwrite any vanilla LOD source meshes in BSAs. If a mod makes specific note about its own LOD source mesh to overwrite DynDOLOD Resources they need to be loose files and the mods instructions should be followed.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>DynDOLOD Resources LOD source textures need to overwrite any vanilla LOD source textures. New lands mods often add the same vanilla LOD source textures again for no apparent reason, but DynDOLOD Resources LOD source textures also need to overwrite them. This more or less happens automatically because the loose DynDOLOD Resources files overwrite any vanilla LOD source textures in BSAs. HOWEVER, any texture replacer mod that ships with its own LOD source textures most likely should overwrite DynDOLOD Resources LOD source textures, even if the mod makes no mention of it. Again, those files need to be loose as well.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Object LOD source textures created by TexGen.exe for the current load order need to overwrite DynDOLOD Resources LOD source textures and also any LOD source textures from mods.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>When updating, existing DynDOLOD plugins need to load after any other plugins of the same type (e.g. highest ESM, highest ESP) when generating, so that any mod that modifies worldspaces and cells can be added as master. There will be all kinds of messages if order is out of place.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generated LOD meshes and generated LOD atlas textures should always load after any other mod and not be overwritten by anything else.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically Generated DynDOLOD.esp can be sorted by LOOT or manually if you know what you are doing :)</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>When LOD is generated, records from the last plugin that is the winning overwrite are copied to create the DynDOLOD plugins. Sort and finialize the load order before generating the LOD patch. If later plugins were added or their load order changed, consider to generate LOD from scratch again. It is also possible to manually patch the records in the DynDOLOD plugins (or whatever plugin is the last to overwrite a record that requires the forwarding) or sort the plugin to load after the DynDOLOD plugins in case new LOD generation is not needed or wanted.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>DynDOLOD Resources also contains a few updated full models and textures to fix various minor issues. They should overwrite unofficial patches and Skyrim particle patch for ENB. Typically they should be overwritten by other mods - sometimes at the expense of LOD maybe not matching as well anymore. This is depends on user preference.</p>

<p>Worldspace is a large location in the game that typically has LOD.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Child worldspace is a small location in the game that is planted into a worldspace with LOD.
