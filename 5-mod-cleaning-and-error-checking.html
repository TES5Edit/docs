            <h2 class="ctrl">5.1 Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>xEdit provides several tools that help mod authors to clean their mods of extraneous / duplicated references, fix deleted references and to merge plug-ins together. These utilities can help a mod author avoid many conflicts with other mods and is considered a best practice. It is highly recommended that mod authors clean their mods before they are released to the general public, which can avert silly and embarrassing compatibility problems after release and make for a more professional showing in the community.</p>
                <p>Mod quality is a community wide problem and needs to be addressed on that level. If everyone just tweaks their load order around and cleans mods they installed that's not going to move us forward as a community. It is important that if there are general issues with a mod that these be made public and the author of the mod fixes them. With many of the possibly conflicting changes that a mod makes, it becomes a question of intent when cleaning them up, and only the mod author can give an authoritative answer to that.</p>
                <p>This chapter is really dedicated to mod authors, and can be safely ignored by mod-users (whew!). Mod Authors that use the GECK should realize that the GECK can set the modified flag on a thing very easily, and that gets saved into your mod as an override to some standard object. The problem comes when players integrate your mod with others that make intentional changes to the standard object that you inadvertently saved &#8211; which is the cause of more conflicts than any other kind between mods today.</p>
                <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> Those not convinced by now to read-through and understand the mod cleaning and merging process are sloppy and should be sacked. For the honorable modders who want to contribute to the community in the right way, read-on.</p>

            <h2 class="ctrl">5.2 Mod Cleaning Process</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>What is the mod cleaning process anyway? The mod cleaning process involves cleaning a mod file of duplicate/un-necessary records and un-deleting objects in the masters that were inadvertently deleted - setting them to disabled instead. We also check for errors as well as looped level lists. The itemized cleaning process is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identifying and removing records in a mod file that is identical to those in the master files, which user useless in a mod-file and can cause conflicts with other mods. Removing these from your mod file is a primary goal of this process.</li>
                    <li>Identifying any records in the master files that was marked as deleted, which xEdit un-deletes and marks as, "disabled" instead. This ensures that any change made to that object by other mods won't cause crashes or conflicts, which can happen if a modder accidentally deletes a base object, which is modified by another mod and you get a null pointer &#8211; poof!</li>
                    <li>Identifying any infinite loops in the leveled-lists, and ensure there are no physical/data errors with the mod file to round-out the clean-up.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p class="img"><img  height="427" src="img/image116.jpg" width="576"></p>
                    <p>For example, modder A inadvertently double-clicks on a wine bottle and it gets marked for save &#8211; becoming one of the changes introduced by modder A's plug-in. Modder A makes things worse by deleting the whiskey bottle record, removing it from the game!</p>
                    <p>Mod B is added to the player's mod-list, which changes the wine bottle making it stronger. Mod A's plug-in however conflicts with this and can over-ride Mob B's changes without cause (as Mod A's author did not intend to change the wine bottle). Furthermore all occurrences of the whiskey bottle are now bogus. When Mod B tries to change the whiskey bottle, it finds no whiskey bottle to change and Fallout3 will crash.</p>
                    <p>Modder A could avoid both of these issues with the mod cleaning process, which un-deletes references that were deleted on accident and un-does inadvertent changes to things in the game that were not intended. The screenshot below illustrates the start of the process, in which you must load-up xEdit and follow the steps herein:</p>
                </div>
                <p>Once, "OK" is clicked (D), xEdit will load the selected plug-in for cleaning.</p>
                <p>Note that you can also, "Select All" or "Invert Selection", which gives you additional controls over which mod-files are selected for loading into xEdit. For the mod cleaning process, we only want to load the plug-in being cleaned. You can do this using the, "Select None" menu option, and then clicking on the mod file to be cleaned.</p>
                <p>You should only clean one mod file at a time, and you should not clean other people's mod files! There is no harm in running through the process to see if mod A or mod B is filled with dirty edits (after which you can send them a PM on the forums!), but it is considered a bad idea to clean other people's mods.</p>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p class="img"><img src="img/image118.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Once loaded into xEdit, we need to apply a Filter to detect all of the Identical to Master references in the mod being cleaned.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Clicking on, "Apply Filter" (B) will present the Filter window, just as it did with the <a href="4-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#s_4-5">Conflict Resolution Process</a>. This filter window however will utilize different options than with conflict detection, as in this case we are only looking at one mod file and one specific kind of conflict &#8211; the Identical to Master references.</p>
                <p>The options to select for Mod Cleaning are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>By conflict status for this particular record</li>
                    <li>Identical to Master</li>
                    <li>Conflict status inherited by parent</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p>The screenshot below illustrates the filter options to select:</p>
                    <p class="img"><img  src="img/image343.jpg"></p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p>Clicking on, "Filter" (C) will launch the xEdit analysis for Identical to Master records, which should complete in a short period of time (perhaps 1-20 seconds). If your system is very slow or bogged down or the mod is really huge, it is possible for the process to take longer. The status of xEdit can be viewed in the title bar, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
                    <p class="img"><img src="img/image122.jpg"></p>
                </div>
                <p>Both the elapsed time and processed records are shown in the title bar. When xEdit completes the analysis, the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-5">Messages Tab</a> will reveal the result as shown on the next page. You should also not expect to see in anything yet in the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-7">View Tab</a>.</p>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p>The output of the filter can be seen in the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-5">Messages Tab</a> as shown below:</p>
                    <p class="img"><img src="img/image124.jpg"></p>
                </div>
                <p>The total number of records filtered and the elapsed time are given, which should be quick. Also note the Green text and the different background color in the screenshot above, which indicate there are references to be cleaned out.</p>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p class="img"><img src="img/image126.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The records to be cleaned will be shown in the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-7">View Tab</a>. At first if you don't see anything in the view, this is because "Hide no conflict rows" is active. Which means any rows that don't have a conflict are normally not shown (as they play no role in conflict resolution, they are not conflicted!). The screenshot below shows you the simple operation you can perform to see the records that need cleaning:</p>
                </div>
                <p>As long as "Hide no conflict rows" is not set in the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-7">View Tab</a>, you will be able to see all of records just as you do during conflict detection.</p>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p class="img"><img src="img/image128.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Note the grey text with green background in the mod we are cleaning; indicating that they are identical to the master versions of the same record and should be removed (cleaned). These are often called, "dirty edits".</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p>A simple visual inspection between the Fallout3.esm and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/867">BetterCaravans</a> mod reveals the duplicated records that really don't need to be in the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/867">BetterCaravans</a> mod at all. Removing these will have no negative impact on the mod or Fallout3. The process of removing the duplicated, "identical to master" records involve applying a slightly different filter to the mod, followed by several context menu options as shown in <a href="#s_5-2-1">5.2.1 Removing "Identical to Master" Records"</a> and in <a href="#s_5-2-2">5.2.2 Un-deleting and Disabling References</a>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="level-3" id="s_5-2-1">
                    <h3 class="ctrl">5.2.1 Removing "Identical to Master" Records</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <div class="p-img">
                            <p class="img"><img  src="img/cleaning-select-applyfilter.jpg"></p>
                            <p>There are two ways to apply the filter for cleaning. One way is to right click in the Navagation treeview and choose "Apply Filter for Cleaning". Many guides will suggest this option. There is no difference in using "Apply Filter for Cleaning" or using "Apply Filter" but both will be shown so you have a better understanding of what is happening and the filter process.
                            <p>Clicking on the, "Apply Filter" button from the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-2">Navagation treeview</a> context menu will present the Filter window once again.</p>
                            <p class="img"><img src="img/image118.jpg"></p>
                            <p>This time choose the Mod Cleaning settings as shown below:</p>
                            <p class="img"><img  src="img/image131.jpg"></p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="p-img">
                            <p>As before the status of the filtering process is shown in the upper-right menu bar, and once complete the log-file output is shown in the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-5">Messages Tab</a>. This filter will load only the data that needs to be cleaned from the mod. The screenshot below again shows how the output may look from this step &#8211; which should take just a few seconds:</p>
                            <p class="img"><img src="img/image132.jpg"></p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="p-img">
                            <p>With the Mod Cleaning filter applied, Golly! It's time to get out the <a href="http://www.mrclean.com/en_US/magic-eraser.do">Mr. Clean</a> and make this puppy sparkle with goodness! Grab the mop by Left-clicking on the mod that you want to clean, in our case <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/867">BetterCaravans</a> (A). Splash the <a href="http://www.mrclean.com/en_US/magic-eraser.do">Mr. Clean</a> on by Right-clicking the shiny white space beneath the mod your cleaning (B), and spin that mop into action by clicking on, &#8216;Remove "Identical to Master" records' (C) &#8211; and watch as xEdit puts the shine on that puppy!</p>
                            <p class="img"><img src="img/image134.jpg"></p>
                        </div>

                            <p>You will be presented with the Warning screen, press, "Yes" when prompted:</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>As xEdit completes the mod-cleaning process, you can see the output in the Messages Tab, which shows you every record that is being removed along with its hex ID number. Once complete, you get a line of text reading, [Removing "Identical to Master" records done] &#8211; along with statistics on the number of records processed and removed as well as the elapsed time (A).</p>
                        <div class="p-img">
                            <p>The screenshot below illustrates the output:</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The final output is also printed in the bottom status bar (B) for your viewing pleasure. With this, the first step in the mod cleaning process is complete and we will move on to the next step which is in <a href="#s_5-2-2">5.2.2 Un-deleting and Disabling References</a>.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The next step in the cleaning process is to Undelete and Disable References from the mod being cleaned. The, "Undelete and Disable References" function scans through the mod and the master files it depends upon, looking for any records that you may have deleted by accident. If it finds some, it will un-delete them and then set the reference to, "disabled" so that it will never be seen in-game nor affect your mod.</p>
                        <div class="p-img">
                            <p class="img"><img src="img/image142.jpg"></p>
                            <p>This ensures that if another mod tweaks/changes the item you deleted, that the item will still be in the files (just disabled), and thus won't cause Fallout3 to crash. If your mod file loads with the item deleted and another mod tries to change it, Fallout3 will crash! L These are among the more serious conflicts that can occur and the reason why it is important for mod authors to run this function as part of the mod cleaning process. The screenshot below illustrates how to activate it:</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Note that you must Right-click on the mod in the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-2">Navagation treeview</a> to pull the right context menu. In this case you do not want to click on open-space.</p>
                        <div class="p-img">
                            <p class="img"><img src="img/image144.jpg"></p>
                            <p>The screenshot below shows the results, which show the log-file output in two places (A and B) in the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-5">Messages Tab</a> and on the lower status bar:</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Now we know for sure that other mods will not run into missing references that were a consequence of changes made in the mod your cleaning. With the second step in the cleaning process complete, it's time for the final step.</p>

                        <h3 class="ctrl">When should you use Sort Masters?</h3>
                        <p>According to Elminster: If a plugin has two masters that are siblings (one doesn't have the other as a master, so they can load in either order) and they are overriding the same record from an earlier master (e.g. both are overriding a record from the main game master file), then loading them in a different order will result in a different version of the overridden record being the "winner". But the plugin might depend on the winner being the one indicated by the order in which it references the masters.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Master File References are links or references from your Plug-in to any Master files (ESMs) that it depends on to run, and stores the list in a record called, "MAST". Most Plug-ins have the game's ESM file in their master list, but you can have many such links in a plug-in. For example for Fallout3 each file will start with Fallout3.esm. If when you create a <a href="4-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#s_4-8">Merged Patch</a> with xEdit, it puts links to many or nearly-all of the master files in your mod list. It is possible in some cases for a Plug-in to contain a link to a master file that it does not need.</p>
                        <p>For example, suppose the Plug-in we are cleaning had MasterB.esm in its MASTer list but it doesn't contain any overrides for, or makes any other references to, records from MasterB.esm. In that case we would not need nor want MasterB.esm listed in the MASTer record for our Plug-in! This function detects any un-used MASTer references in the Plug-in we are cleaning, and removes them from the MASTer list. xEdit also renumbers any file specific FormIDs in the Plug-in to ensure that it is cleaned properly.</p>
                        <p>The screenshot below illustrates how to activate the, "Clean Masters" function:</p>
                        <p class="img"><img src="img/image146.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Unfortunately there is no log-file output for this function. If you see "Done cleaning masters" and no issues or errors in the Messages Tab, then the function cleaned the masters correctly.</p>
                        <p>The screenshot below illustrates how the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/867">BetterCaravans</a> mod looks now that it's clean, with it's new sparkly (bold)-Green text in the <a href="2-overview.html#s_2-3-2">Navagation Treeview</a> (A):</p>
                        <p class="img"><img src="img/image148.jpg"></p>
                        <p>At this point you should save your mod and load it up in-game to make sure that everything is still happy.</p>
                        <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> You should not clean other people's mods! It is the responsibility of each mod owner to clean their own mods, and with the creation of this tutorial there is no longer any excuse why people can do this. If you find a dirty mod, send the mod author a PM on Nexus and tell them they have a dirty mod and reference them to xEdit (please?)

                        <p>When using Clean Masters if references are still in use the Master will not be removed from the master list. In order to list references we will be using a script named <code>List records referencing specific plugin.pas</code>. This may take a while depending on how many references there are in the Plug-in.</p>
                        <p class="img"><img src="img/list-ref-master-done.jpg"></p>
                        <p>For the above example I chose to list the references used by 04 for <code>PointLookout.esm</code>.
                        <p>A notification will appear in the messages tab when the operation is complete. All of the records referencing the plugin will be listed. You will need to properly deal with all the references before xEdit will remove the master. This could mean changing a reference to reference another master or removing the reference entirely.</p>
                        <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> You should not remove masters from other people's mods! You will drastically effect the mod and it will no longer perform the changes the author intended. It is the responsibility of each mod owner to remove unused masters. You can request that the mod author provide another version. Please be respectful if they refuse to remove masters as some mod authors intentionally override specific records in order for the mod to effect the game the way they intended.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p>The "Check for Reference Errors" function reports any case in which the information contained in a module file does not match the xEdit record definitions. There is a very minimal chance that something that's reported as an error is actually an oversight in the xEdit record definitions and not in the module, but all cases should be reported to be safe. Note that there are errors in the Fallout3.esm and the DLCs. Both <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/167469">Elminster</a> and Quarn have gone through them all to ensure they are genuine errors. Running the check is a recommended practice as part of the mod-cleaning process as shown below:</p>
                    <p class="img"><img src="img/image150.jpg"></p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-img">
                    <p>When the error-check is complete, the screenshot below shows you how the output will look when errors are found in a module:</p>
                    <p>PACK \ Locations \ PLDT - Location 1 \ Location -> Found a NULL reference, expected: ACHR,ACRE,PBEA,PGRE,PLYR,PMIS,REFR</p>
                    <p>In this example a reference was found but xEdit expected a different type of reference. These kinds of errors are not serious and should be sent to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/167469">Elminster</a> to ensure xEdit has the right information.</p>

                    <p>In this example we found Unresolved Reference errors (Ouch!) These errors are very serious as they indicate a record from the mod is trying to reference something, but what it is looking for is missing from the mod or the master of the mod. Mod authors should never leave these uncorrected! They should be corrected by the mod author and not by you!.</p>
                    <p class="img"><img src="img/checkerrors-unresolved.jpg"></p>

                    <p>With mods it is possible to have Leveled Lists that reference other Leveled Lists that are perfectly valid. However, it's possible in some cases that a mod builds a circular reference (with as little as 2 leveled lists directly referencing each other, or any number of additional leveled lists in the chain). When the game engine then tries to resolve that leveled lists down to a particular item/creature/NPC, it can get caught in the endless loop and crash. This function looks for such cases and identifies them if they exist:</p>
                </div>
                <p>I have not yet found an example in any mod of such a circular leveled list, but I do know that they exist and that xEdit can spot them. If you don't get any output from running this function, then the checked mod is clean of such loops.</p>

            <h1>Appendix A</h1>
            <h2>Types of Dirty Edits:</h2>
            <h3>Identical To Master</h3>
            <p>Identical to Master (ITM) edits are the most common type of dirty edit. They're where a mod has overwritten something in the game without actually changing anything. If another mod higher up in the load order makes an intentional change to that thing, it will have its effect cancelled out by the ITM record, which can cause problems. ITM edits can be cleaned automatically using xEdit.</p>
            <dl>
                <dd><b><i>Example 1: Identical To Master Edits</i></b></dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dd> Consider a quest mod in which the author has also changed the properties of some sneaking settings to better fit with other areas of the quest mod. The author then later decides the sneaking changes are unnecessary, and sets them back to their original values. If this quest mod were then loaded after a mod that overhauls the sneaking system, the sneaking overhaul's effects would be at least partially undone by the quest mod, which is not the effect intended by the author of either mod, nor the effect desired by the user.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dd> The solution would be to clean the quest mod, which would remove the ITM edits and allow the sneaking overhaul mod to function as intended.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Deleted Reference</h3>
            <p>Deleted references are a significant cause of crashes and game bugs. This is because if one mod tries to modify a reference that another mod has deleted, then the first mod cannot find the reference, and this then causes problems. A deleted reference can be fixed by undeleting then disabling the references and moving it to a position where it is no longer visible in the Creation Kit (xEdit sets the Z axis position to -30,000 units). This has the same effect as deleting the reference, without causing issues. Deleted references can be cleaned automatically using xEdit.</p>
            <h3>Deleted Navmeshes</h3>
            <p>Like deleting records, deleting navmeshes can cause crashes. However, these cannot be automatically corrected, and require manual cleaning.</p>
            <h3>Wild Edits</h3>
            <p>Wild edits are unintentional or misdirected edits to game elements by a mod author that cause unnecessary conflicts with other mods. They are called wild edits because they often appear to have been made haphazardly with no relation to the author's stated intentions. Because detecting wild edits involves knowing what the mod is supposed to do, they must be cleaned manually.</p>
            <p>One example of a wild edit would be when a container is incorrectly modified to include an item, but instead of only that one container including the item, the result is that all containers of the same type include the item. If the description of the mod states that an item is added to a specific container, then it is clear this is a wild edit and the mod should be cleaned by fixing the wild edit.</p>

        <h1>Glossary</h1>
        <p>This glossary contains definitions for the general modding terms and cleaning-specific terms used in this guide.</p>
        <p><b>Mod</b>: A modification for Skyrim. Can be player-made or official DLC.</p>
        <p><b>Plugin</b>: A file with a .esp or .esm file extension (well, it's what's inside the file that matters, but the file extension is a pretty good clue).</p>
        <p><b>Record</b>: A data structure inside a plugin that holds the information on one element of the game. For example, each type of weapon, each race, each potion, etc. have different records.</p>
        <p><b>Rule of One</b>: Only one plugin's changes to a record can be applied by the game. If multiple plugins change the same record, then the changes from the last of those plugins in the load order will be applied. There are a few exemptions, eg. if multiple plugins put things into the same cell, then all those things will be seen in-game, but in general the rule holds for non-complex record types (and complex record types are beyond the scope of this guide).</p>
        <p><b>Load order</b>: The order in which plugins are loaded.</p>
        <p><b>Dirty mod</b>: A mod that contains dirty edits, wild edits, deleted references or any combination of them.</p>
        <p><b>Dirty edit</b>: An edit made which is unnecessary, often caused by Creation Kit bugs or authors making unintended edits then undoing them incorrectly. Such edits can be cleaned automatically.</p>
        <p><b>Identical To Master edit</b>: A type of dirty edit made where the edited value(s) is/are identical to the value(s) without the edit.</p>
        <p><b>Wild edit</b>: An edit made which is not consistent with the intent of the mod, often caused by authors accidentally making small edits or trying to perform an edit in the wrong way. Such edits must be cleaned manually.</p>
        <p><b>Deleted reference</b>: A reference to a record that has been deleted. For example, placing a Silver Sword into the game world creates a Silver Sword reference there, which may then be removed by deleting it.</p>
        <p><b>Dependency</b>: A plugin upon which another plugin relies. For example, Skyrim.esm is a dependency for most mods.</p>
        <p><b>Explicit dependency</b>: A dependency that is recorded within the dependent plugin, such that the game cannot be loaded without the dependency being satisfied.</p>
        <p><b>Implicit dependency</b>: A dependency for which there is no indication given within the dependent plugin, and which can only be determined by considering author intent.</p>
