						<p>Or something... For whatever it's worth, I'm really glad you've published your programs and, personally, find them more useful in a lot of cases than even the TES4 CS/GECK. Your editors lend a bird's eye perspective which is otherwise unavailable and no &lt;oxymoron&gt;serious gamer&lt;/oxymoron&gt; running or creating mods for FO3/TES4 should be without them. Had Bethesda used your tool to &quot;check for errors&quot; and &quot;undelete and disable refs&quot; before releasing The Pitt, it would have had fewer or no problems. I hope you never stop publishing your editors. &lt;3 FO3Edit smile.gif</p>

						<p>Thanks Elminster, this has saved me much frustration. I had been sorting through and manually changing small groups of mods to esm before this and this is so much easier and after a somewhat brief testing - far more reliable.</p>

						<p>The skin issue should be corrected. Tarrant's FO3Phalanx mod NPC companion Deisha had the right skin color when I used it. I've been testing the earlier versions since yesterday and encountered a few hiccups, but ElminsterEU's been quick and helpful in resolving them. It's been going smoothly since then.</p>

						<p>the masterupdater is fantastic, i may be wrong however but i think its somehow caused enclave radio to come back on air during broken steel, but it only ever airs the pre-finale loop.</p>

						<h3 class="ctrl">HeyYou Feedback:</h3>

						<p>I am running 1.4 version of the game, with <a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4888"><abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr></a>. Also have the pitt, and O:A installed. Game runs perfectly stable, no crashes in several hours of play, no other problems that i noticed either, by all appearances, the list merger is working as advertised, i have encountered raiders, supermutants, and even Enclave with weapons from a couple different installed mods. So far, I have experienced nothing but happy playing, with all of my mods cooperating.</p>

						<p>Thank You very much.</p>

						<p>This mod is amazing. Before, when I embarrassingly did not know how to use it, it was crashing like crazy. When I figured out to rename it to what you said, I just had to disable two mods--one that allowed me to go over level 100, and another that calculated classic carrying weight in Fallout 1 and 2, so basically these two altered leveling and stuff. After I disabled them, it worked, then it only crashed when the CPU overloaded with enemies on-screen when I was doing Take it Back! (I use Marts Mutant Mod increased increased spawns), so too many Enclave Troopers.</p>

						<p>Anyway, thank you for this amazing, amazing mod. The entire weekend, I was trying to figure out how to get the damned Fake Patch to work, and it never did. When you were taking Testers, I wanted to join but was a bit skeptic. When people said it was good, I wanted to try it, but then you released it when I was going to ask. When I got it to work, I immediately got the Hellfire Armor, an incinerator, loads of ammo, and more because of a MMM increased increased spawn vertibird encounter. Its been so stable. You are truly a savior!</p>

						<p>Hi Elminster,</p>

						<p>I just wanted to say thank you for this. You're a credit to the community!</p>

						<p>I'll take this opportunity to say that most of the mods on this board couldn't have been done as quickly as they are without FO3Edit, and even some mod features would be impossible to do without it. MMM fits into this category.</p>

						<p>So thankyou, Elminster :)</p>

						<p>This new update is like an answer to a prayer. The Disappearing navmeshes and statics was driving me nuts. Works great for me.</p>

						<p>I'm officially recommending your Master Update program in my FAQ. If you could quickly check the blurb in my faq to make sure I didn't leave anything out about using the program I'd appreciate it. Thanks for the great work Elminster.</p>

						<p>After getting everything set up correctly (as far as I know tongue.gif) My Fallout 3 1.5, Unofficial FO3 Patch, FOOK+MMM has been as stable as it possibly can be. Haven't had a CTD for a day now, played it lot to during.</p>

						<p>I just want to send out my grateful thanks to ElminsterEU for his FO3Edit/MasterUpdate!</p>

						<p>And to all the people that sent feedback etc.</p>

						<p>Thank you ever so much!</p>

						<p>Just wanted to say thanks for this. Using the MasterUpdate function has solved crash-on-save problems for me, now the game works perfectly... and now that it's 'fixed' I can actually enjoy the fact that patch 1.5 seems to run faster then unpatched. Woohoo!</p>

						<p>You sir are a god. I love being able to use my old mods while using the 1.5 patch.</p>

						<p>Thanks for the tools, FO3 has been more stable for me than it has been in a LONG time, I am able to use the 1.5 patch and all the mods i use to use before the patch without any CTD biggrin.gif</p>

						<p>I just wanted to say thanks.</p>

						<p>Master Update allows my mod to work with 1.5.</p>

						<p>Thats a lot of work to get shot down by a patch.</p>

					<div class="level-3 quote">
						<h3 class="ctrl">Chadwick:</h3>

						<p>I must say thank you for the FO3MasterUpdate. It fixed all of the problems I was having with the CTDs when I used mods that conflicted with the 1.5 patch. FO3Edit is undoubtedly a godsend. So again, thank you very much.</p>

						<p>I hope this is the right place to post praise. :)</p>

						<p>Great work Elminster! Again I very much appreciate all the work you have done on this! I just tested with my configuration and it worked very smoothly as before, I'll be testing today. I also like the MasterRestore mode! Makes it alot easier when going back and forth between GECK and Fo3 for troubleshooting issues.</p>

						<p>Thanks again!!</p>
