            <h2>9.1 Sorting is not Alignment (SINA)</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
                <p><img src="img/sortalign-1.jpg"></p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why aren't the rows lining up? "NIluva [Niluva Hlaalu]" [NPC_:0001336E] are the same and, they are in both lists, aren't they?</p>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sorting is not Alignment (SINA) and to understand that I will show some examples with both xEdit and Beyond Compare a Diff program comparing xEdit source.
                <p><img src="img/sortalign-2.jpg"></p>
                <p>The above example shows the same type of issue. The block of code starting with "wbRecords(DLBR, 'Dialog Branch'..." exists on both sides. The text is not aligned because the text is out of range of the alignment algorithm. The block of text "wbRecords(SMEM, 'Story Manager Event Node'..." interferes with the alignment.</p>
                <p><img src="img/sortalign-3.jpg"></p>
                <p>One of the differences with Diff programs is that you can force alignment of code. As shown in the screen shot if I choose "Align With" I can specify where the focus of the alignment should start.</p>
                <p><img src="img/sortalign-4.jpg"></p>
                <p>Once that happens now "wbRecords(DLBR, 'Dialog Branch'..." is aligned on both sides but since Diff programs do not alter the text in the file prior to aligning it now "wbRecords(SMEM, , 'Story Manager Event Node'..." is no longer aligned.</p>
                <p><img src="img/sortalign-5.jpg"></p>
                <p>To illustrate that I used Paint to cut and paste the information in the first column to align with the common element in the second column. This is identical to the "Align With" feature in the Diff Program. However, there is no such function to change the focus of the alignment. Even if you could the rest of the information that is not common on both sides is shifted up.</p>
                <p><img src="img/sortalign-6.jpg"></p>
                <p>The only way to have all the common information aligned is to alter the order of the information which is sorting. You are no longer aligning common information within range you are sorting the information so it will align. That is not what alignment is, Diff programs have no such sort first functionality, and neither does xEdit. Sorting is not Alignment or SINA and to desire both sorting and alignment, you should repent your sins.</p>

            <h2>9.2 ESL vs ESM</h2>
            <div class="main-content">
                <p><a href="https://www.creationkit.com/fallout4/index.php?title=Data_File">Data File - Source CK Wiki</a></p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Discussing the behavior of ESL vs ESM files only applies to Fallout 4 and Skyrim SE.</p>
                <p>ESL flag controls how FormIDs are mapped, it has nothing to do with load order.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>without ESL Flag: mapped into a full slot (xx yyyyyy)</li>
                    <li>with ESL Flag: into a light slot (FE xxx yyy)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>General ESM and ESL behaviour:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ESM flag affects load order (all ESM load before non-ESM) and other behaviours</li>
                    <li>Files with the .esm and .esl extension, on load, will have the ESM flag force set in memory even if it's not set on disk.  You can't make ESM or ESL files behave as non-ESM (ESP) files.</li>
                    <li>After a file is loaded by the engine, the extension doesn't matter anymore. All that counts is the value of the ESM and ESL flag in memory. Possibly overridden by the game engine on load based on extension.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>General ESP behaviour:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An ESP file with ESM flag should behave like an ESM file</li>
                    <li>An ESP file with ESL and ESM flags should behave like an ESL file</li>
                    <li>An ESP file with only the ESL flag does map it's FormIDs to FE xxx, but it will not behave like a ESM</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Load order as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Game's Master</li>
                    <li>Update.esm [Skyrim SE]</li>
                    <li>DLCs in official order</li>
                    <li>CCs in official order</li>
                    <li>All ESM (flag after load) in plugins.txt order</li>
                    <li>All non-ESM (flag after load) in plugins.txt order</li>
                    <li>Inside the "ESM block" you can have .esl, .esm, and .esp files mixed in any order based on plugins.txt, as long as they all have the ESM flag (implicit or explicit)</li>
                    <li>Inside the "non-ESM block" you can have only .esp (because it's impossible to have a .esm or .esl without ESM flag)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One last exception to this, it's possible for non-ESM to load in the ESM block, if a ESM flagged file has the non-ESM listed as master. any module that is being loaded will force all it's listed masters to load before it.</p>

                    <p>Beginners will be presented with the Warning screen when choosing to make changes to a module.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/EditWarning.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Pressing, "Yes" when prompted will allow you to make changes.</p>

                    <p><img src="img/warn-edit-header.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Unless you are an advanced user and know what you are doing you should not alter the module's header. One example is removing masters from the module's header.  Removing masters without using <a href="https://tes5edit.github.io/docs/5-mod-cleaning-and-error-checking.html#s_5-3-6">Clean Master</a> will cause unresolved references for any records that still reference the master. You should always remove masters using Clean Masters.  However, if you need to make an alteration and know exactly what you are doing then adding the command line parameter <code>-AllowMasterFilesEdit</code> along with <code>-IKnowWhatImDoing</code> will enable you to edit the module's header.</p>

                    <p>Or something... For whatever it's worth, I'm really glad you've published your programs and, personally, find them more useful in a lot of cases than even the TES4 CS/GECK. Your editors lend a bird's eye perspective which is otherwise unavailable and no &lt;oxymoron&gt;serious gamer&lt;/oxymoron&gt; running or creating mods for FO3/TES4 should be without them. Had Bethesda used your tool to &quot;check for errors&quot; and &quot;undelete and disable refs&quot; before releasing The Pitt, it would have had fewer or no problems. I hope you never stop publishing your editors. &lt;3 xEdit smile.gif</p>

                    <p>Thanks Elminster, this has saved me much frustration. I had been sorting through and manually changing small groups of mods to esm before this and this is so much easier and after a somewhat brief testing - far more reliable.</p>

                    <p>The skin issue should be corrected. Tarrant's FO3Phalanx mod NPC companion Deisha had the right skin color when I used it. I've been testing the earlier versions since yesterday and encountered a few hiccups, but ElminsterAU's been quick and helpful in resolving them. It's been going smoothly since then.</p>

                    <p>I am running 1.4 version of the game, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/4888"><abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr></a>. Also have the pitt, and O:A installed. Game runs perfectly stable, no crashes in several hours of play, no other problems that i noticed either, by all appearances, the list merger is working as advertised, i have encountered raiders, supermutants, and even Enclave with weapons from a couple different installed mods. So far, I have experienced nothing but happy playing, with all of my mods cooperating.</p>
                    <p>Thank You very much.</p>

                    <h3>Red Lotus:</h3>
                    <p>This mod is amazing. Before, when I embarrassingly did not know how to use it, it was crashing like crazy. When I figured out to rename it to what you said, I just had to disable two mods--one that allowed me to go over level 100, and another that calculated classic carrying weight in Fallout 1 and 2, so basically these two altered leveling and stuff. After I disabled them, it worked, then it only crashed when the CPU overloaded with enemies on-screen when I was doing Take it Back! (I use Marts Mutant Mod increased increased spawns), so too many Enclave Troopers.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, thank you for this amazing, amazing mod. The entire weekend, I was trying to figure out how to get the damned Fake Patch to work, and it never did. When you were taking Testers, I wanted to join but was a bit skeptic. When people said it was good, I wanted to try it, but then you released it when I was going to ask. When I got it to work, I immediately got the Hellfire Armor, an incinerator, loads of ammo, and more because of a MMM increased increased spawn vertibird encounter. Its been so stable. You are truly a savior!</p>

                    <p>Great work Elminster! Again I very much appreciate all the work you have done on this! I just tested with my configuration and it worked very smoothly as before, I'll be testing today. I also like the MasterRestore mode! Makes it alot easier when going back and forth between GECK and Fo3 for troubleshooting issues.</p>
                    <p>Thanks again!!</p>
                    <p>M</p>
