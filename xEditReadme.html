    <h2>Our GitHub Issue Tracker:</h2>

    <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> offers a place to submit and
        discuss feature requests and bug reports. When using it, please ensure that any criticism you provide is
        constructive. Please do not use the tracker for general help and support on how to use xEdit.</p>

    <h3>General Support:</h3>
    <p>Make backups of your plugins and report any issues in the official Bethesda thread. If you have never used
        TES5Edit, Wiki Pages and basic videos are available.</p>
    <p>We only support the most recent version of xEdit and the game. Update xEdit and the latest version of the game
        before you post in the forum.</p>

    <h3>Naming Conventions:</h3>
    <p>If you see any references to xEdit that is a short way of saying all versions of the program which would cover
        xEdit, FNVEdit, FO4Edit, TES4Edit, TES5Edit, SSEEdit.</p>

    <p>Rename to TES4Edit.exe to work with Oblivion.<br>
        Rename to TES5Edit.exe to work with Skyrim.<br>
        Rename to SSEEdit to work with Skyrim SE.<br>
        Rename to xEdit.exe to work with Fallout3.<br>
        Rename to FNVEdit.exe to work with New Vegas.<br>
        Rename to FO4Edit.exe to work with Fallout 4.</p>

    <h3>Documentation:</h3>

    <p>The only documentation ever made for xEdit was provided by Miax and JustinOther. They have generously provided
        the Fallout Training Manuals. The one thing people may not realize at first is that the training manuals
        apply to all versions of xEdit. The manuals go over the basics of how to use xEdit and becaue the UI for
        xEdit hasn't changed over the years you can still use the examples. About the only thing that has changed are
        the contextual menus but they are minor changes.</p>

    <h2>Future of xEdit:</h2>

    <p>We appreciate all the thanks and support from the community. We would like to thank all the users that made
        bug reports on the Nexus or in the Bug Tracker. Zilav and Hlp continue to make various bug fixes and
        improvements. Zilav is usually adding more scripting functions while Hlp is still working on having a working
        Save game editor. Currently early testing only allows you to view save games. It was exciting that
        ElminsterAU had some time to make some optimizations to the code. The program loads plugins faster then before
        and uses less memory.</p>

    <h2>Previous versions such as xEdit, FNVEdit, TES4Edit:</h2>

    <p>We understand that sometimes updates to programs break things. Please use the updates with caution. However,
        please use them and then report issues so we can improve the program. Our goal is to make all versions as bug
        free as possible and introduce new features that are useful for the modding community for all the Bethesda
        games this utility supports.</p>
